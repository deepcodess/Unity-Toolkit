Purpose:
Provides helper functions to generate random values, positions, colors, or elements — all in a clean and reusable way.
Instead of writing Random.Range() or shuffling logic every time, you just use RandomData methods.


Common uses:
Random enemy spawns
Random loot drops
Randomized effects (like random color, size, or movement)
Procedural generation
